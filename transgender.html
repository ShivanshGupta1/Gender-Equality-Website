    <h1>Issues <b> Transgender people</b> are facing</h1>
    <div calss ="mydiv">
       <p> <br>
       <br>
       <b>Most transpeople are not given Equale rights and oppurtunities by co-workers</b><br>
       <b>They are ussually bullied and called names</b><br>
       <b>Life of a transperson is much harder than that of any other gender</b><br>
       <b>They are Humiliated on a day to day Baisis</b><br>
       <b>They are subjected to unwanted comments</b><br>
       <b>When they start a coversation with someone else they May be ignored </b><br>
       <b>They are usually excluded form group activities and excursions</b><br>
    </p>
    </div>
    <p>Listed bellow are some of the issues trsansgender people face</p>
    <br><br>
    <ol>
      <li>A serious flaw of the Indian Education system is that it does not facilitate skill acquisition. 
        While passing up the grades, many students drop out and the learning gap increases, leading to an inefficient workforce in the community.
         Many trans gender persons fall into this division and the provision of skill-based education can help close these gaint gaps</li>
      <li>There has been no formal recognition of education for trans gender persons in India but there has been a wave of change that can be seen in society.</li>
      <li>Trans gender persons face a lot of problems while accessing health care services and there have been numerous incidents to suggest improper behaviour and discrimination displayed towards them
      </li>
      <li>Refusal of care, solely, for the reason of being a trans person is a major problem as of today.</li>
      <li>Further, harassment and violence — including physical attacks, assault and harassment in the EMT’s — also stand as a deterrent to avail proper healthcare.</li>
      <li>The main question concerning work comes into picture when the legal acknowledgment of the trans person is in question. Identity documents are important to avail basic civil rights such as the right to vote, right to education, inheritance rights, health, and public services, etc. Hiring biases, on-the-job discrimination, wage inequalities, lack of legal resources, inability to access documents and denied benefits stand in the way of employment opportunities for trans gender persons. Apart from stopping harassment at workplaces, equal access to benefits at the workplace should also be promoted, so that trans gender persons can live a productive and healthy life.</li>
      <li>The stigma that the trans community faces leads to a lack of opportunities, and a recurring form of exclusion from benefits and acceptance.</li>
      <li>Sensitisation in schools/work place towards trans gender persons</li>
      <li>Hospitals and medical staff also are unaware as to how to treat transgender people, and how to meet their needs, as there is a lack of treatment awareness</li>
      <li> The health vulnerabilities include diseases such as HIV, rectal gonorrhoea, syphilis, rectal chlamydia, and various forms of sexually transmitted diseases. The major barriers that arise out of discrimination are also widespread and present during transition-related care. Defining a trans person through their surgical status should not be promoted and it is the duty of every medical professional to prevent this sort of behaviour.</li>
