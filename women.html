    <h1> Discrimnation against women:</h1>
    <h3>1.They are not given equal opportunities</h3>
    <h3>2.They are forced to to follow the stereotpical gender role that society has set for them </h3>
    <h3>3.They are pushed to marry at a very young age to men that are much elder to them</h3>
    <h3>4.They are told that their job is just to give birth to children and look after them</h3>
    <h3>5.Even when they have the freedom of doing what they want and they get a job, they are disrespected and are payed less for no reason</h3>
    <h3>6.Their partner is sometimes voilent and threatning</h3>
    <h3>7.Across many conservative communities in Saudi Arabia, women still face this major social bulwark. Despite it not being a law, women are still not allowed licenses and can only exercise the right to go out in public if accompanied by a chaperon. The Arab Spring in 2011 resulted in a deluge of rallies and protests among women. Even though society is becoming more progressive, especially with regards to allowing women to contribute to the labor force, it will take further social reform to overcome this hindrance.</h3>
    <h3>8.Upon the pretext that women should not ‘flaunt their beauty,’ women in many conservative communities have to wear the complete body burqa, coupled with loose-fitting clothes when they are out in public as an interpretative exegesis of the Sharia Law. Many world leaders like U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May have spoken against the issue which is very pervasive in Saudi Arabia, Gambia, Sudan and North Korea.</h3>
    <h3>9. Honour killing:This is a deplorable practice that revolves around the hidebound idea that girls have to uphold the supposed ‘cachet’ of their families and abide by the patriarchal demands of the society. Honor killing is largely attributed to the poor education system and ineffective government legislation among rural communities. Consequently, Qandeel Balcoh was killed by her brother Waseem Ali in 2016 because she had supposedly brought dishonor upon her family because of how she expressed herself on social media.</h3>
